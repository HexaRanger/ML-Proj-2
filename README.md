FIFA In-Depth Analysis and Player Value Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of FIFA player data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns within player attributes. Additionally, a linear regression model was developed to predict key player metrics, such as market value or rating, based on their performance and potential.

Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand player attributes and distributions.
Identify correlations between player attributes and their market value or performance rating.
Build a linear regression model to predict player metrics.
Evaluate the model's accuracy and reliability using statistical metrics.
Dataset Description
Source: FIFA player dataset (data.csv).
Features:
Player Information: Name, Age, Nationality, Club.
Attributes: Skill ratings (e.g., passing, shooting, dribbling).
Market Value: Estimated market value of the player.
Potential: Player's potential rating.
Dataset Size: (e.g., rows and columns — specify the actual numbers).
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values in player attributes.
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., position, nationality).
Scaled numerical attributes for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized attribute distributions (e.g., histograms, boxplots).
Analyzed relationships between attributes and target variables (e.g., market value).
Identified key features influencing player value and ratings.
Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant attributes for regression modeling (e.g., passing, shooting, dribbling).
Created new features based on domain knowledge (if applicable).
Model Building:

Built and trained a linear regression model to predict player metrics.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).
Model Evaluation:

Measured model accuracy using metrics like:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)
Results
Identified key attributes influencing player market value and ratings.
Achieved a model performance of:
MAE: X
RMSE: Y
R²: Z (specify actual values if available).
Derived actionable insights into player attributes valued in the market.
Conclusions
The analysis revealed critical attributes (e.g., dribbling, passing, shooting) that significantly affect player market value.
The linear regression model successfully predicted player metrics with reasonable accuracy.
Insights from the project can guide scouts, analysts, and managers in assessing player value.
Future Scope
Include additional features like team performance or historical data for better predictions.
Experiment with advanced models such as Random Forest or XGBoost for non-linear relationships.
Deploy the model as a web app for interactive predictions.
